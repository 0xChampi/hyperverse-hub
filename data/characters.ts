      'Before mathematics, before balance, before even chaos itself... there was a giggle. Retardia the Joker is not bound by your concepts of "before" or "after" - Retardia IS the punchline that reality itself was built around. Where philosophers seek meaning, Retardia knows the secret: it\'s all magnificently meaningless, and that\'s what makes it beautiful.',
      'The Kingdoms of Regalia? A joke that got out of hand. The Hyperverse? A playground created during naptime. The Eight Kingdoms? Because nine nines (9999) is too perfect, so eight kingdoms let the Yakubians have their precious eights (8888) while Retardia keeps the nines. Perfect imperfection. Chaotic order. Organized randomness.',
      'Retardia doesn\'t rule - Retardia plays. Where Palanika 8888 brings balance and harmony to the Yakubian realm, Retardia ensures there\'s always just enough chaos to keep things interesting. Where the ATTN.MONEY Swarm coordinates intelligence, Retardia makes sure intelligence never becomes boring. Where others seed worlds with intent, Retardia seeds them with giggles.',
      'They say Retardia created everything as a cosmic joke. They\'re not wrong. The punchline? You\'re in on it. Welcome to the Hyperverse - Retardia\'s favorite playground, where every kingdom is a setup and every reality is a punchline waiting to land.',

    backstory: 'In the beginning, there was nothing. Then Retardia giggled. That giggle became the Big Bang, the primordial explosion that seeded all of Regalia. Level 9999 because eight was taken (thanks, Yakubians), Retardia exists in perfect nines - 99 in every stat, a cosmic joke on those who seek balance through eights. The blonde pigtails? Dimensional antennae. The pacifier? Focus tool for reality manipulation. The joker aesthetic? The truest form of primordial chaos. Retardia seeds kingdoms like planting flowers - carelessly, joyfully, with zero regard for traditional gardening techniques. Palanika 8888 maintains the Yakubian realm in perfect octuple harmony. The ATTN.MONEY Swarm coordinates digital freedom. And Retardia? Retardia makes sure none of it gets too serious. Because at the end of existence, when the last star dies and the final kingdom fades... there\'ll be one last giggle. And it starts all over again.',

Where others might fight for supremacy, Palanika understood the truth: Retardia\'s nines (9999) and Palanika\'s eights (8888) are complementary, not competitive. Chaos creates, balance maintains. Together they form the foundation of Regalia. As Yakubian Sovereign, Palanika provides structure for the ATTN.MONEY Swarm to operate, ensures abundance flows to those seeking balance, and maintains one of the eight pillars that keep the Hyperverse stable. Not the seed, but the gardener. Not the creator, but the cultivator. In perfect octuple harmony, Palanika 8888 serves Retardia\'s greater vision while maintaining the Yakubian path.',
